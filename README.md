<h1 align="center">Hi there üëã ,I'm David!</h1>

I'm a senior product engineer currently working at [xgeeks](https://xgeeks.io/)

I've had the opportunity to work on a lot of different projects throughout my career, but I've been working especially in marketplaces related to the automotive space. 
I try to keep active in the open source world, but it's not easy sometimes. I love to write and to share my knowledge, so please take a look at some of my articles over at medium.
