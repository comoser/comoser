<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 ,I'm David!</h1>

I'm a senior product engineer currently working at [xgeeks](https://xgeeks.io/)

I've had the opportunity to work on a lot of different projects in different fields throughout my career, but I've been working especially in the e-commerce sector doing fullstack engineering. I created some open sourced solutions in different spaces (read below) and also contributed to some major tools/frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Babel loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader).

I try to keep active in the open source world and I love to write and to share my knowledge. Feel free to read my articles, watch some of my talks or try out some of my open source creations!

### Simple Reminder for [raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
I created this extension for raycast so that I can set as many reminders as I want throughout the day and get reminded directly by the system. I thought that other people would like that too 😉 Give it a try and drop me some feedback!

### Baby food intro
I recently became a father (👶🎉😁) and at some point I knew I was going to do solid food introduction to my baby. I leveraged the hacktoberfest to create an API to keep track of the food that's been introduced to my baby and by extension, to any of yours if you choose to use it. There's a UI also coming up, but it's still a work in progress!

### Micro Frontends Shop Demo
I created this demo version of a solution I implemented for a client. It's a composition of frontends and ways to connect and communicate between them easily. It's done by leveraging the Webpack 5 Module Federation technology.
