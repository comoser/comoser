<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 ,I'm David!</h1>

I'm a senior product engineer currently working at [xgeeks](https://xgeeks.io/).

I've had the opportunity to work on a lot of different projects in different fields throughout my career, but I've been working especially in the e-commerce sector doing fullstack engineering. I created some open sourced solutions in different spaces (read below) and also contributed to some major tools/frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Babel loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader).

I try to keep active in the open source world and I love to write and to share my knowledge. Feel free to read my articles, watch some of my talks or try out some of my open source creations!

<h2 align="center">👨‍🏫 I'm mentoring!</h2>

I recently joined [ADPList.org](https://adplist.org/mentors/david-alecrim) as a mentor and I'm providing mentoring sessions through the platform. If you want to schedule a session with me or if you know someone that wants to, just access the [bookings page](https://adplist.org/mentors/david-alecrim) and schedule something, I'd be happy to connect with you and discuss your problems.
