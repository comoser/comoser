<h1 align="center">Hi there üëã ,I'm David!</h1>

I'm a staff engineer currently working at [xgeeks](https://xgeeks.io/).

I've had the opportunity to work on a lot of different projects in different fields throughout my career, but I've been working especially in the e-commerce sector doing fullstack engineering. I created some open sourced solutions in different spaces (read below) and also contributed to some major tools/frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Babel loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader).

I try to keep active in the open source world and I love to write and to share my knowledge. Feel free to read my articles, watch some of my talks or try out some of my open source creations!
