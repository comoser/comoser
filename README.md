<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 , my name is David!</h1>

I'm a senior software engineer currently working at xgeeks <img src="https://xgeeks.io/assets/favicon/favicon-32.png" alt="xgeeks" width="18" />

I've had the opportunity to work on a lot of different projects throughout my career, but I've been working especially in marketplaces related to the automotive space. 
I try to keep active in the open source world, but it's not easy sometimes. I love write and share my knowledge, so please take a look at some of my articles over at medium.
