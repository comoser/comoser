<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 , my name is David!</h1>

I'm a senior software engineer currently working at xgeeks <img src="[https://xgeeks.io/assets/favicon/favicon-32.png](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5a9970f1b4aef250c04c91482a0bdc030baf40ff383bce29938b64635605f606/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e6c6963646e2e636f6d2f646d732f696d6167652f43344430424151474e642d52335f535f4773772f636f6d70616e792d6c6f676f5f3130305f3130302f302f313636333736313630313034343f653d3136383836303136303026763d6265746126743d57516e5a587a535373363347556b6e6b30654848784c5f447675446354564f566261384d6d736f36334473)" alt="xgeeks" width="18" />

I've had the opportunity to work on a lot of different projects throughout my career, but I've been working especially in marketplaces related to the automotive space. 
I try to keep active in the open source world, but it's not easy sometimes. I love to write and to share my knowledge, so please take a look at some of my articles over at medium.
